你應該很快樂
再也沒有我的打擾了
我有時也會覺得
是不是擋住了你人生的景色

都說孤單夠了 成熟了
就知道這一頁該翻過去了
在你眼裡我不算什麼
一個人的世界不也挺好的

我們終究也成路人了
就這樣誰也不理誰了
我卻揮灑最好的青春
作了撲火的飛蛾

我都沒有關心的資格
還有什麼可以欠你的
我都騙了自己多久了
以為死心塌地 早把你……

看清了 放下了 鬆手了
親愛的 對不起 打擾了

作了撲火的飛蛾

我都沒有關心的資格

我都騙了自己多久了
以為死心塌地 早把你
把你忘了

You should be /quite happy
No more troubles, no more of me
Sometimes I/ still wonder
Was it me/ in your way, keeping all your dreams at bay

They say/ lonely nights fade/ one's grown
Should know to turn the page and let it be
In your eyes, I never meant that much
A world of one isn't that just fine?

In the end, we are passersby
Just like that, no words, no closure.
Yet I spent my best/ years for you,
Like a moth in the flame

I no longer hold the right to care
What else could I/ owe you there?
How long have I been lying to me,
Thinking desperately/ I'd already......

You should be/ quite happy
No more troubles, no more of me

In your eyes, I never meant that much
A world of one isn't that just fine?

In the end, we are passersby
Just like that, no words, no closure.
Yet I spent my best/ years for you,
Like a moth in the flame

I no longer hold the right to care
What else could I/ owe you there?
How long have I been lying to me,
Thinking desperately/ I'd already......

Now I see/ Let it be/ Let it go
My dear/ I'm sorry/ Forgive me

In the end, we are passersby
Just like that, no words, no closure.
Yet I spent my best/ years for you,
Like a moth in the flame

I no longer hold the right to care
What else could I/ owe you there?
How long have I been lying to me,
Thinking desperately/ I'd already......
Left you behind
